      <Text>This is an example of a story file with customized story margins (namely, _10.0_ on each side instead of the default _40.0_). In addition to that, we will also explore some PageObject margins while we're at it! This is going to be fun.</Text>
      <Text MarginLeft="80.0">This text should be shunted to the right a bit. The right edge should remain where you'd expect.</Text>
      <Text MarginRight="80.0">The left edge of this text should be where you'd expect, but the right edge is a bit more toward the left.</Text>
      <Text MarginLeft="80.0" MarginRight="80.0">This text should be squashed from both the left and right sides. Yowzer!</Text>
      <Text MarginTop="20.0">Normally, paragraphs have no top margin and a bottom margin of _20.0_. This paragraph has a top margin of _20.0_ with the default bottom margin, so it should be a bit further away from the above paragraph than you'd expect.</Text>
      <Text MarginBottom="0.0">This paragraph's bottom margin has been forced to _0.0_. It should be nestled right against the text below.</Text>
      <Text>Hi! I'm just here to prove the above paragraph's point.</Text>
